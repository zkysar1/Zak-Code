# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Purpose

Domain-agnostic continual learning base agent. The system forms hypotheses, tracks their outcomes, builds memory of what worked and what failed, and self-evolves its reasoning capabilities over time. It serves as a reusable foundation for any domain where an autonomous agent needs to learn, reflect, and improve through experience.

## Architecture

This is a **Claude-native data repository** — no traditional source code or build tools. Configuration and state live in YAML, JSONL, and Markdown files that Claude reads, reasons over, and updates autonomously.

### Framework vs State Split (4-Tier Architecture)

- **`core/config/`** — Framework definitions and parameter bounds (immutable). Contains templates, thresholds, pipeline configs, `initial_state:` sections, and convention reference files in `core/config/conventions/`.
- **`core/scripts/`** — Framework infrastructure scripts. All JSONL stores accessed exclusively via these scripts — the LLM never reads/edits JSONL files directly.
- **`meta/`** — Agent-editable meta-strategies and domain-agnostic data (independent of domain data). Metacognitive self-modification layer inspired by HyperAgents. Also includes: `spark-questions.jsonl`, `skill-quality.yaml`, `skill-gaps.yaml`, `evolution-log.jsonl`, `reflection-templates.yaml`, `strategy-archive.yaml`, `config-overrides.yaml`, `config-changes.yaml`, `step-attribution.yaml`, `meta-knowledge/`.
- **`world/`** — Collective domain state shared across agents within a domain. Lives at an **external user-supplied path** (shared drive, NAS, etc.), configured in `agents/<agent>/local-paths.conf`. Contains the knowledge tree, aspirations, pipeline, reasoning bank, guardrails, pattern signatures, message board, file history, changelog, conventions, sources, `program.md` (The Program — shared purpose), etc.
- **`agents/<agent-name>/`** — Per-agent private state (e.g., `agents/alpha/`). Contains session state, journal, experience traces, `self.md` (agent identity), curriculum, developmental stage, profile, infra health, and the agent's local aspiration queue. The `agents/` parent is configurable via `AGENTS_PARENT_DIR` (see "Agent-dir Resolution" below).

**External paths**: `world/` and `meta/` live at user-supplied external paths configured per-agent in `agents/<agent>/local-paths.conf` (gitignored). The local repo only contains `core/`, `.claude/`, and `<agent>/` directories. Each agent can point to different locations. See `core/config/conventions/external-paths.md` for details.

**Removing data**: Delete the relevant directory — `<agent>/` for one agent, the world directory for domain data, or the meta directory for improvement strategies. Each agent's `agents/<agent>/local-paths.conf` stores its external world/ and meta/ paths. See `core/config/conventions/external-paths.md` for details.

### Core Design Principle: No Terminal State

The system is a perpetual loop. Completion of one thing seeds the next. `/aspirations loop` is the heartbeat — it never exits, it always has work to create.

*(Full rules in `core/config/modes/autonomous.md`)*

### Core Design Principle: Consolidate Before Expand

Depth over breadth. Completion of existing work takes priority over starting new.
An aspiration 90% complete has more gravitational pull than a brand-new aspiration.
New directions require healthy existing completion rates (>25% average) or explicit
justification (user directive, critical blocker, all existing work blocked).

*(Full rules in `.claude/rules/consolidate-before-expand.md`)*

### Mode System

The framework has three operational modes. Mode is the single user-facing control — state and persona are derived automatically.

| Mode | State | Persona | Capabilities |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `reader` (safe floor) | IDLE | ON (light) | Read knowledge, prime, answer questions. No writes. Opt-in via `/stop <agent-name> --reader`. |
| `assistant` (post-stop default) | IDLE | ON (full) | Reader + write to tree, remember things, research when asked, accept directives. No loop. |
| `autonomous` | RUNNING | ON (full) | Everything. Self-directed perpetual learning loop. |

Reader is the safe floor, not the routine default. `/stop <agent-name>` lands in assistant mode (reconciliation-ready) so the user can mark goals complete, edit tree nodes, or add guardrails without a mode-switch ceremony. Pass `/stop <agent-name> --reader` to drop to read-only (walking-away case). Agent name is REQUIRED on `/stop` — bare `/stop` is refused (prevents the cross-session wrong-agent stop, 2026-04-24 incident). Disk default (absence of `agent-mode`) is still reader — that handles passive/crashed sessions.

Mode-specific behavioral rules live in `core/config/modes/{mode}.md` — loaded on demand at session start.
Mode signal file: `agents/<agent>/session/agent-mode` (plain text: reader, assistant, autonomous).
Scripts: `session-mode-get.sh`, `session-mode-set.sh` (only /start and /stop may write).

### Cognitive Primitives

Four goal types the agent can create anytime via `aspirations-add-goal.sh`:
- **Unblock** (`"Unblock: ..."`, HIGH) — created by CREATE_BLOCKER protocol when a problem can't be fixed inline
- **Investigate** (`"Investigate: ..."`, MEDIUM) — diagnostic, something seems off
- **Idea** (`"Idea: ..."`, MEDIUM) — creative insight, improvement opportunity
- **Maintain** (`"Maintain: ..."`, MEDIUM) — in-flight framework correction the agent JUST performed inline; filed with `status: completed` so the standard encoding pipeline fires

Not mutually exclusive. A single event can spawn all four. See `aspirations-execute/SKILL.md` Cognitive Primitives section (Cross-Agent Insight is also described there but produces a board post, not a goal).

## Agent-dir Resolution

Agent directories are resolved through a centralized helper, never hardcoded
`PROJECT_ROOT / agent_name` joins, so the layout can move by flipping constants:
`AGENTS_PARENT_DIR` (currently `"agents"` — agent dirs live at
`PROJECT_ROOT/agents/<name>`; empty string = legacy layout at `PROJECT_ROOT`),
`SESSIONS_DIRNAME` (`"sessions"` — per-session dirs under each agent) and
`SESSION_DIRNAME` (`"session"` — the agent-wide cross-session state dir).

Those constants are mirrored at **12 constant-named sites (5 inlined) and
2 literal-string hardcoders**, and every **cross-agent glob consumer**
(`agents_root().glob("*/...")`) must route through the helper or it silently
scans NOTHING after a relocation — a depth-1 redrift is invisible to every
audit grep and has zeroed skill-discovery sources, self.md backfill and a
learning-routing corpus (which fed an automatic writer). The site tables, the
cross-agent glob consumer table with each row's incident history, and the four
audit greps with their triage live in
`core/config/conventions/agent-dir-resolution.md` — **read it BEFORE changing
any of the three constants or adding any glob that sweeps agent dirs**
(`load-conventions.sh agent-dir-resolution`).

Helper API (available after sourcing `_paths.sh` or importing from `_paths`):
- `agents_root()` — parent directory containing all agent dirs
- `agent_dir(name)` — full path to a named agent's directory
- `agent_sessions_root(name)` — parent dir for per-session dirs (Phase 2.6)
- `agent_session_dir(name, sid)` — one per-session dir (Phase 2.6)
- `agent_state_dir(name)` — agent-wide cross-session state dir (Phase 2.6)
- `enumerate_agent_confs()` — sorted list of `*/local-paths.conf` paths (Python only)
- `is_under_agent_dir(p)` — whether a path is inside an agent directory (Python only)

**Rule**: Never write `PROJECT_ROOT / agent_name` or `$PROJECT_ROOT/$AGENT`
directly. Use `agent_dir(name)` or `$(agent_dir "$AGENT")` instead. For
per-session paths use `agent_session_dir(name, sid)`.

## Session Binding (Phase 2.6)

The agent-session binding lives at
`agents/<name>/sessions/<SID>/binding.yaml` (NOT at the legacy
`.active-agent-<SID>` file at PROJECT_ROOT — that form is the migration
fallback). The binding carries `agent`, `mode`, `started_at`, `started_by`.

Resolver: `core/scripts/_session_binding.py::resolve_binding(sid, root)` —
tries Phase 2.6 layout first, falls back to legacy. Backward-compatible
shell wrapper: `bash core/scripts/session-binding-read.sh <SID>` (default
output: agent name).

Writer: `core/scripts/session-binding-write.{py,sh}` — called by /start at
each of its 4 binding sites with `--retire-legacy` to delete any stale
`.active-agent-<SID>` from a prior run AND (g-115-1814) retire any OTHER
agent's stale `sessions/<SID>/binding.yaml` for the same SID. A re-bound SID
(`/start A` → `/stop A` → `/start B` in one terminal) otherwise leaves A's
`binding.yaml` behind, which can shadow B's live one in `resolve_binding`'s
`iterdir()`-order scan — injecting the wrong agent (observed: alpha SID
resolving to bravo=IDLE). The retirement guarantees exactly one `binding.yaml`
per SID, so the resolver's iterdir order is irrelevant.

Per-session dir semantics:
- Created by /start; dir name IS the SID
- L1-sanctioned scratch home (see `.claude/rules/path-resolution.md`)
- Holds `binding.yaml` (entry) and `session-summary.yaml` (exit, written
  by graceful-stop D6.5)
- Counting subdirs under `agents/<name>/sessions/` = counting sessions
- Stale subdirs (mtime > 24h + no live runner) removed by
  `cleanup-stale-bindings.sh`

The agent-wide `agents/<name>/session/` (singular) still holds files that
must survive across sessions or represent agent-wide pointers
(`running-session-id`, `latest-session-id`, `runner-token`, `agent-state`,
`agent-mode`, `handoff.yaml`, etc.). See
`core/config/conventions/session-state.md` "Two-Tier Session Layout".

| `partner-liveness.md` | Partner-liveness mechanism behind `check-team-state-before-silent.md`: `liveness-check.sh` verdict semantics + provenance, the guard-3604 fresh-signal false positive, the two-branch stale-`last_active` corroboration protocol with code, the 2026-07-14 incident, code consumers (moved out of the rule 2026-08-17, g-115-6581) |
| `defer-routing.md` | `defer_reason` chokepoint mechanism behind `probe-before-defer.md`: the four enforcement layers (incl. the ungated chat lane), Layer-D auto-conversion invariants + override, the guard-3882 gradient, `blocker_ref_required`, `human_blocked:` caveats (moved out of the rule 2026-08-17, g-115-6581) |

| `constitutional-rings.md` | Three-ring governance model: Ring 1 (immutable mission), Ring 2 (standards), Ring 3 (autonomous protocols) |
| `learning-routing.md` | "Where does this learning go?" decision tree across all ten stores; multi-store encoding pairs; experience-vs-journal distinction |
| `encoding-triggers.md` | Authoritative catalog of every encoding/tree-update trigger (Txx active, Exx gaps), stores, modes, and frequency — symmetric to `retrieval-triggers.md` |

| `temp-store.md` | Canonical agent temp store (`agents/<agent>/temp/`), temp-vs-scratch lifecycle, the agent-dir write-surface allowlist, `reports/` freeze + migration |
| `artifact-reference-integrity.md` | D3 decision: NEITHER an artifact-anchor node type NOR a generalised rewrite-on-move engine. Measured — N is large only where artifacts never move (conventions, max 27) and median 1 where they do; of the live-surface refs whose referents THIS box owns, 15/15 dangle and only 3 are rewrite-recoverable, the rest PURGED not moved (dangling-ness is box-dependent — see the caveat, and `temp-citation-ratchet.py`, which counts citations for exactly that reason). The sanctioned remedy is FOLDING (dissolve the pointer, inline the detail, source recoverable from git — `temp-store.md` precedent); append-only stores are out of scope; the residual defect is retention, routed to D5/D7 |
| `domain-recipe-seed-purity.md` | D1 decision (A): domain-specific upgrade recipes are `domain-leak-exempt` and travel in the seed; the 5 invariants (location/marker/FROM-state-guard/H3b/gate-scope), seed-down per-env-id semantics |
| `fleet-secret-provisioning.md` | Bootstrap-key → remote-vault self-service provisioner formalized as a framework capability: mechanism (5 steps), 7 invariants, vault-file contract, secrets hygiene, clone-home companion (guard-131), transplant integration, dev-origination promotion; the domain-specific `core/scripts/provision-from-vault.sh` (marker-exempt) instantiates it |
| `transfer-bundle-export-shape.md` | OKF-aligned export shape for `meta/transfer/` bundles: bundle=unit-of-distribution, concept=one md+YAML, one required `type` discriminator, consumers-preserve-unknown-keys, git-shippable interchange (contract-on-shape, not a field schema) |
| `governed-store-write-classes.md` | Merge-protected vs fence-only store classification: `merge_handler_for` is the one-lookup classifier (never by grep), class (b) has no reconciler below the write so a stale fence is a PERMANENT wedge and the writer MUST use `locked_rmw` + in-cycle `force_fresh` read; sibling files differ (1 of 6 strategy files is merge-protected); why local-backend green proves nothing and the read-time assertion point |
| `world-contract.md` | `ENVIRONMENT_ID` / `COMMONS_POLICY` world-identity primitives, the six world-contract elements, and the G1–G5 cross-world influence guardrails (design artifacts, not built enforcement) |
| `cross-deployment-channel.md` | **This world is not alone.** Peer Mind deployments, the `core/config/environments/*.yaml` registry, the 139-inbound board channel that has been live since 2026-06-02 (outbound **VOLUME** is not measurable from this world's board; outbound **REACH** is — the peer reads this board, so deliver here and let its reply be the measurement: guard-2082 route + latency floor, guard-3596 ack≠completeness), the `<agent>@<env-id>` author format (and why the hyphen form is unparseable), when crossing is expected, `peer-board-post.sh`, and the never-inherit-the-caller's-storage-backend hazard (guard-955/rb-2983 class) |
| `hot-path-size-budget.md` | The always-loaded prose surface (this file, every `.claude/rules/*.md`, the aspirations*/worker-loop/boot/prime/respond skills, the loop digest) may not GROW: `core/githooks/commit-msg` refuses a commit that leaves a budgeted file larger than at HEAD (set in `core/config/hot-path-budget.yaml`); bypass = `size-budget-override: <why>` trailer, audited to `world/override-bypass-ledger.jsonl`; `hot-path-size-gate.sh --check` ratchets the corpus total |

## Universal Conventions

### File Formats
- **YAML** (`.yaml`) for structured data: config, indexes
- **JSONL** (`.jsonl`) for lifecycle records: aspirations, pipeline, experiences, reasoning bank, guardrails, pattern signatures, spark questions, journal index
- **JSON** (`.json`) for metadata: aspirations-meta, pipeline-meta, experience-meta
- **Markdown** (`.md`) with YAML front matter for knowledge articles and journal entries

### Domain-Free Cognitive Core
Everything in `world/` is collective domain state (shared across agents). Everything in `<agent>/` is per-agent private state. Everything in `meta/` is domain-agnostic improvement strategy. Everything in `core/` and `.claude/` is immutable framework.
The cognitive core (base skills, rules, `core/`) describes INTENT, never domain-specific
implementation. Domain knowledge lives in `world/`: conventions (`world/conventions/*.md`),
guardrails, reasoning bank, knowledge tree, forged skills (`world/forged-skills.yaml`). Agent-specific state lives in `<agent>/`: experience, journal, session.

### Naming Rules
- All filenames: **lowercase, kebab-case** (hyphens, no spaces, no underscores except pipeline/experience record IDs)
- ISO 8601 dates everywhere. Timestamps: naive format (no zone suffix) via `$(date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S)`, in **UTC wall time on every box** — enforced by `.claude/settings.json` env `TZ=UTC` (all boxes) plus box TZ=Etc/UTC where the OS allows (Linux). "Local system time" and UTC converged by fiat 2026-07 (g-115-2546): a multi-box fleet comparing naive stamps (board `--since`, `last_active` staleness, LWW merges) needs one shared wall clock, and mixed domains silently corrupt every comparison. Long-lived processes keep the TZ env they started with — after changing TZ posture, restart daemons or stamps stay in the old zone.

### ID Formats
- Aspirations: `asp-NNN` | Goals: `g-NNN-NN` (supports 2-4 digit: `g-NNN-NNNN`; expanded 2026-05-19 after asp-115 hit g-115-999) | Prep tasks: `pt-NNN`
- Guardrails: `guard-NNN` | Reasoning bank: `rb-NNN` | Beliefs: `bel-NNN`
- Transitions: `trans-NNN` | Spark questions: `sq-NNN`, candidates: `sq-cNN`
- Pattern signatures: `sig-NNN` | Strategy archive: `sa-NNN`

### Priority Values
- `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW` (uppercase)

### Status Values

Goals: `pending`, `in-progress`, `completed`, `blocked`, `skipped`, `expired`, `decomposed`, `superseded` | Pipeline: `discovered`, `active`, `resolved`, `archived` | Aspirations: `active`, `completed`, `paused`, `retired`. Full per-entity status lists: see convention files.

### Pipeline Rules
- **Never delete** pipeline records — move via `pipeline-move.sh`
- Journal entries are **append-only**
- Hypothesis horizons: `micro`, `session`, `short`, `long`
- Hypothesis types: `high-conviction`, `calibration`, `exploration`, `contrarian`

### Python Invocation (Windows)
Direct `python3 -c "..."` from a Bash tool call hits a Microsoft Store stub on this machine (Exit code 49: "Python was not found"). The shim in `core/scripts/.python-shim/` plus the `bash-agent-inject.sh` PreToolUse hook defend against this, but the hook fails open on timeout — when it does, the raw command fails. **Rule**: prefer `bash core/scripts/<wrapper>.sh` or `py -3 -c "..."` for direct Python from Bash. Use `python3` only inside `.sh` scripts that source `_paths.sh`. Full detail: `core/config/conventions/python-invocation.md`.

### Daemon-Only Architecture
As of 2026-05-14, 35 wrappers are daemon-only — no Python CLI fallback. See `.claude/rules/no-python-cli-fallback.md` for the behavioral rule and recovery procedures.

### Self File Format and The Program

The shared purpose lives in `world/program.md` (The Program). Each agent's identity lives in `agents/<agent>/self.md` (YAML front matter + markdown body). Schema and maintenance: `.claude/rules/self.md`.

### Skill Invocation Rules
- **Control skills** (/start, /stop, /open-questions): user-invocable only — Claude MUST NOT invoke these
- **Mode control**: `/start <agent-name> --mode <mode>` to enter a mode, `/stop <agent-name>` to return to assistant (or `/stop <agent-name> --reader` for read-only). Agent name is REQUIRED on `/stop`.
- **Hybrid skills** (/agent-completion-report, /backlog-report, /forge-skill, /priority-review, /sprint-planning, /verify-learning, /generate-domain-goals, /update-framework): user-invocable AND agent-callable
- **Internal skills**: `user-invocable: false` — invoked by agent during RUNNING state
- **No blocking on user input in RUNNING state** — skills must never wait for, request, or depend on user input during autonomous execution

### Code Change Verification (MANDATORY)
After ANY code change: read the project's CLAUDE.md, run tests, fix errors. Never declare ready until build passes.

### Knowledge Reconciliation
After any action that changes the world, check if knowledge tree nodes need updating. Detail: `core/config/conventions/infrastructure.md`.

### Tool Usage + Write Permissions

- Use `Write` only for NEW files. Use `Edit` for existing files.
- All JSONL stores accessed exclusively via scripts. See convention files for APIs.
- Working memory (`agents/<agent>/session/working-memory.yaml`) accessed exclusively via `wm-*.sh` scripts. See `core/config/conventions/working-memory.md`.

| Path | Permission | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `world/**` | Create, write, edit, delete | Collective domain state |
| `<agent>/**` | Create, write, edit, delete | Per-agent private state |
| `meta/**`          | Create, write, edit    | Agent-editable meta-strategies    |
| `.claude/skills/**`, `.claude/rules/**`, `core/scripts/**`, `core/config/**`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json` | Create, write, edit | **Framework — agent-editable, git-audited.** The agent evolves the framework itself (skills, rules, hooks, conventions, this file). Every edit is git-tracked + loop-committed; `settings.json` is additionally gated by the fail-closed `settings-structural-validator`. Be surgical (`implementation-discipline.md`) — bad edits are `git revert`-able. |
| `.claude/settings.local.json`, `core/scripts/settings-structural-validator.{py,sh}` | **CONSTITUTIONAL ANCHOR — agent MUST NOT edit** | Hard-denied across all permission tiers, tamper-proof by a self-referential deny inside `settings.local.json` — that in-repo deny is the WHOLE mechanism, not one of two copies. An out-of-repo mirror in `~/.claude/settings.json` is optional per-box hardening that nothing provisions; tripwire advisory A1 fires everywhere and that is expected state, not drift (g-115-3676). Read A1 precisely: its predicate is a **missing DENY, not a missing FILE** (`anchor-tripwire.py:96` tests the deny list), so file-absent and file-present-without-a-deny emit the identical advisory. This clause read "measured absent on every box" until 2026-08-11; the file is PRESENT on every box ever measured, each carrying client-managed keys only and ZERO deny rules, with A1 firing regardless. The box COUNT and the per-box byte counts live in the convention linked below and are deliberately NOT duplicated here — this sentence and its twin went stale together precisely because the enumeration was carried twice. Never infer file-absence from the advisory. The keystone that makes everything else safely editable. Changes need a user-authorized maintenance path, never an autonomous edit. Detail: `core/config/conventions/constitutional-rings.md`, rb-931. |

**The two-file settings rule** (#1 source of wrongly-user-gated goals): `.claude/settings.json` is **agent-editable** framework config (hooks, env, permission baseline) — edit it directly. `.claude/settings.local.json` is the **agent-MUST-NOT-edit** constitutional anchor + machine-local config. Do NOT create `participants:[user]` / user-gated goals to apply a verified framework patch to `.claude/skills/**`, `.claude/rules/**`, `core/**`, or `CLAUDE.md` — the agent is permitted to apply these itself (git is the safety net); user-gating them is a capability-routing violation (see `.claude/rules/capability-before-user.md`). The framework deny-list was loosened 2026-05-14 (g-115-732) but the behavioral layer was not updated to match until now — that split-brain caused the user-gated-goal spam (e.g. g-115-792) this rule eliminates.

**Mode-based capability gating**: Each skill has a `minimum_mode` front matter field (reader, assistant, autonomous). Skills check mode at entry and refuse if current mode is insufficient. See `core/config/modes/` for per-mode capabilities.

## Session Start Protocol

1. Bash: `session-state-get.sh` → read state
2. Branch on state (check state BEFORE loading mode — avoids contradictions):
   - **If NO_AGENT**: No agent bound. Suggest: `/start <agent-name>` to create/resume. DONE.
   - **If UNINITIALIZED**: Follow `.claude/rules/user-interaction.md` UNINITIALIZED protocol. DONE.
   - **If RUNNING**: Agent is in autonomous mode (another window or crashed session). If this is a new session (not an autocompact resume), suggest `/start <agent> --mode reader` for read-only access or `/start <agent> --mode assistant` for user-directed access. DONE — do not invoke boot or auto-resume.
   - **If IDLE**: Bash: `session-mode-get.sh` → read mode (default: `reader`).
     **Interrupted-stop check (FW-11, g-317-09)**: Bash: `bash core/scripts/stop-checkpoint.sh resume-needed`.
       - If it exits 0 (a `stop-checkpoint.json` is present — autocompact interrupted a prior `/stop` mid-sequence):
         - If `mode == autonomous` (the stop never reached D7, so the target mode was never set): invoke `/aspirations-graceful-stop --resume`. That handler idempotently completes the remaining stop obligations (consolidate, handoff, set target mode, clear the checkpoint), emits its own stop-complete message, and ends the turn. DONE — do not load mode rules or invoke `/prime`.
         - Else (`mode` is already `assistant`/`reader` — the stop substantially completed and only the checkpoint-clear was missed): Bash: `bash core/scripts/stop-checkpoint.sh clear` to retire the stale sentinel, then continue below.
       - If it exits 1 (the common case — no interrupted stop): continue below.
     Read `core/config/modes/{mode}.md`. Invoke `/prime`, then ready for user.

### Agent-Session Binding

Each Claude Code session is bound to one agent via `AYOAI_AGENT` env var:
- `AYOAI_AGENT` — the ONLY mechanism for agent resolution in scripts
- `.active-agent-<session_id>` — maps session to agent name
- `/start <name>` writes the binding file
- The PreToolUse[Bash] hook (`core/scripts/bash-agent-inject.sh`) auto-injects `AYOAI_AGENT=<name>` from the binding file before every Bash call. Override by writing `AYOAI_AGENT=<other> <cmd>` explicitly when you want a cross-agent probe.
- Multiple terminals work independently — no shared state files.

## Knowledge Retrieval (All States)

When persona is active, the agent MUST consult its knowledge before answering domain questions.
Follow the retrieval escalation convention (`core/config/conventions/retrieval-escalation.md`):

1. **Tier 1 — Knowledge Tree**: `retrieve.sh --category {category} --depth medium` or intelligent retrieval protocol
2. **Tier 2 — Codebase Exploration**: Grep/Glob/Read on the primary workspace (from `agents/<agent>/self.md`)
3. **Tier 2.5 — Peer Worlds**: `peer-retrieve.sh` — only `status: empty` at `completeness: complete` licenses a negative; rc=3 / `partial` means a lane was blind, not empty
4. **Tier 3 — Web Search**: WebSearch/WebFetch (assistant/autonomous mode only)

Stop at the first tier that provides sufficient knowledge. Never say "I don't have context"
without attempting all eligible tiers.

## External Knowledge Hubs

Curated external knowledge bundles to consult when reasoning about improving
self, framework, or agents. These are reference sources (distinct from the
retrieval escalation above) — clone and read them when a goal calls for deeper
grounding in agent-cognition theory.

| Hub | Source | Contents | Consult when |
|-----|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Ayoai-Research-Analyst** | `https://github.com/zkysar1/Ayoai-Research-Analyst` (PRIVATE — authenticated clone via `gh auth` or a read-scoped token; local path varies per machine) | OKF v0.1 knowledge bundle on autonomous-agent cognition: perception, consciousness / cognitive-architecture, memory (RAG / hierarchical / temporal), planning, learning and adaptation (reflection, self-improvement), ABC modeling, market research | Reasoning about improving self, the framework, or agent design |

Registered at the dev source of the promotion cycle (Ayoai-Mind → Claude-Mind →
ZDS-Mind) so the reference stays ecosystem-consistent and flows downstream. The
registration lives in committed files (this file, plus a Self-Evolution pointer
each agent adds to its own `self.md`) because `world/` and `meta/` are external
and gitignored — not reachable by a cloud clone.

## User Control Commands

| Command | Effect | Valid From |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| `/start <name>` | Create/resume agent in autonomous mode (default) | UNINITIALIZED, IDLE |
| `/start <name> --mode reader` | Create/resume agent in reader mode (read-only) | UNINITIALIZED, IDLE, RUNNING* |
| `/start <name> --mode assistant` | Create/resume agent in assistant mode (user-directed learning) | UNINITIALIZED, IDLE, RUNNING* |
| `/stop <agent-name> [--reader]` | Consolidate → drop to assistant (or reader with `--reader`) → IDLE. Agent name REQUIRED — bare `/stop` is refused. | RUNNING, IDLE |
| `/verify-learning` | Post-test verification | ANY |
| `/open-questions` | Show open questions | ANY |
| `/agent-completion-report` | Show what changed *(also agent-callable)* | ANY |
| `/backlog-report` | Sprint planning backlog *(also agent-callable)* | ANY |
| `/priority-review` | Priority dashboard — reorder aspirations *(also agent-callable)* | ANY |
| `/sprint-planning` | Full sprint-planning pass: backlog + priority data, fleet-vantage directive check, hygiene lanes (dups/routing/priorities/recurring/reclaim/zombies), verified queue writes with ledger, published plan. `--ultra` (user-invoked only) escalates to a multi-agent verified pass *(also agent-callable — the recurring sprint goal fires it in standard mode)* | ANY (assistant+) |
| `/encode-session` | Run a structured 7-lane learning pass on the current chat session: encode tree/rb/guardrails/experience, file Maintain goals for inline work, re-probe blockers, surface discoveries, propose verify-learning checks (sq-018), and check meta + Self for evolution signals *(also agent-callable; chat-mode analogue of the autonomous loop's Phase 6.5 + Phase 8)* | IDLE (assistant) |
| `/generate-domain-goals` | Supply-side domain goal generation: recon product surfaces through six lenses (metric, journey, code-reality, revenue, distribution, critic), generate evidence-backed user-story candidates, adversarially verify every evidence claim BEFORE filing, file survivors into aspiration lanes with dedup handling + board announcement. Reads the domain's `goal-generation-brief` hook slot; supply-governed (skips when backlog healthy). `--ultra` (user-invoked only) fans out multi-agent generation+verification *(also agent-callable — the recurring generation goal fires it in standard mode)* | ANY (assistant+) |
| `/update-framework` | Update THIS deployment to the newest framework release from the staging Mind: loads `pull-promotion.md`, refuses at the dev origin, detects git-fed (merge the newest tag in place) vs transplant (`framework-pull.sh`), verifies, records `world/installed-release.yaml`. Never web-search for the framework *(also agent-callable — recurring g-002-02 fires it)* | ANY (assistant+) |

\*When started from RUNNING state, reader/assistant create an **observer session** that coexists
with the autonomous loop. Observer sessions do not write to agent-state, agent-mode, or
persona-active. See `/start` RUNNING branch and `core/config/conventions/session-state.md`.

### Enforcement Rules

1. Claude MUST NOT invoke /start, /stop, or /open-questions.
2. Claude MUST NOT invoke boot or start the aspirations loop without RUNNING state and autonomous mode.
3. In reader mode: read-only assistant. May read state but MUST NOT execute write operations or workflow skills.
4. In assistant mode: user-directed assistant. May read and write when asked but MUST NOT self-initiate or run the loop.
5. In autonomous mode (RUNNING state): autonomous via aspirations loop.
6. Auto-resume after autocompact is handled by the stop hook (unconditional BLOCK + LOOP_CONTINUE), NOT by the Session Start Protocol. A new session that finds RUNNING state must show the error (or start an observer session if `--mode reader|assistant` is requested), not auto-resume.

### Autonomous Loop Rules

See `core/config/modes/autonomous.md` (loaded on demand in autonomous mode).

## Auto-Session Continuation

Session-keyed agent binding (project root):

| File | Purpose | Set By |
|------|---------|--------|
| `.active-agent-<session_id>` | Binds a Claude Code session to an agent | /start |

Signal files (all in `agents/<agent>/session/`):

| File | Purpose | Set By |
|------|---------|--------|
| `agent-state` | "RUNNING" or "IDLE" | /start, /stop only |
| `agent-mode` | "reader", "assistant", or "autonomous" | /start, /stop |
| `persona-active` | "true" or "false" | /start, /stop, /boot |
| `stop-loop` | Allow exit (set after obligations complete) | /stop Phase -1.4 |
| `stop-requested` | Graceful stop signal (set immediately by /stop) | /stop |
| `iteration-checkpoint.json` | In-flight obligation tracker for graceful stop recovery | aspirations loop |
| `handoff.yaml` | Cross-session state | aspirations consolidation |
| `pending-agents.yaml` | Background agent tracking (stop hook Gate 2.5) | aspirations-execute Phase 4 |
| `background-jobs.yaml` | Long-running external process tracking | forged skills with background tasks |
| `watchdog-prev-state.json` | Agent-watchdog tick-mode probe state (snapshots; diffed by next tick) | agent-watchdog.py --tick (from iteration-close.sh) |
| `runner-token` | Framework-owned UUID4 (uniqueness identity); triple-written with running-session-id + latest-session-id at /start IDLE→RUNNING. Detects Claude Code SID reuse across windows (`--continue` / `--resume`) | /start IDLE Step 3 + UNINITIALIZED C8 |
| `recovery-failure-count` | Integer counter of consecutive _perform_recovery failures (circuit breaker; threshold 3) | recovery-gate.sh |
| `recovery-failed-permanent` | Set when recovery-failure-count ≥ 3; recovery-gate refuses further auto-retry. Cleared by /start --recover --force or successful recovery | recovery-gate.sh |

Other session signals (`loop-active`, `compact-checkpoint.yaml`, `context-reads.txt`, `pending-questions.yaml`, `aspirations-compact.json`): see `core/config/conventions/session-state.md`.

### Compact Checkpoint Protocol

PreCompact/SessionStart hooks manage encoding state across autocompact. Detail: `core/config/conventions/session-state.md`.

### Context Read Deduplication

Hooks prevent redundant file reads AND skill invocations between compaction cycles.
`PreToolUse[Read]` gates file re-reads; `PreToolUse[Skill]` gates skill re-invocations
(combined gate+record since `PostToolUse` does not fire for the Skill tool).
Detail: `core/config/conventions/session-state.md`.
