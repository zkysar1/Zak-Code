# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Chronological log of significant, hard-to-reverse decisions. Newest at the bottom.
Format: each ADR has Context, Decision, Consequences, and Status.

---

## ADR-0001 — Clean-room implementation (no forking of prior art)

- **Status:** Accepted (2026-05-30)
- **Context:** We have access to a community reverse-engineering of Claude Code
  (`claw-code`, incl. a Rust port + snapshots of Claude Code's tool/command surface),
  plus open-source agents Hermes (Python) and goose (Rust). Forking the Rust port means
  inheriting an admitted MVP and a steep language; using leaked TypeScript source is
  legally/ethically unacceptable and not vendor-agnostic.
- **Decision:** Build Zak Code **clean-room**. We study architecture and public docs of
  prior art and re-express ideas in our own design. We never copy leaked/proprietary code.
- **Consequences:** Full ownership and a clean IP story; more up-front design work. The
  reverse-engineered material is kept **outside** the repo as read-only study material.

## ADR-0002 — Language: Python

- **Status:** Accepted (2026-05-30)
- **Context:** Choices were Python, TypeScript/Node, or Rust. Hard requirement:
  vendor-agnostic. Soft requirement: readable/extensible for building-and-learning.
- **Decision:** **Python 3.11+**, `src/` layout, package `zakcode`, managed with `uv`.
- **Consequences:** Immediate access to `litellm` (100+ providers) and the richest agent
  ecosystem; most legible for iteration. We forgo Rust's raw performance and TS's tightest
  Claude-Code mirroring.

## ADR-0003 — License: MIT

- **Status:** Accepted (2026-05-30)
- **Context:** Public repo; owner wants freedom for future ("special things later"),
  including potential commercial use.
- **Decision:** **MIT.**
- **Consequences:** Maximal permissiveness and simplicity; no patent grant (acceptable).

## ADR-0004 — Provider abstraction via litellm; first-class Ollama + OpenAI

- **Status:** Accepted (2026-05-30)
- **Context:** Must be vendor-agnostic. Owner has access to **local Ollama** and
  **OpenAI** (not Anthropic) — which conveniently forces a genuinely provider-neutral core.
- **Decision:** All model access flows through a thin provider layer
  (`zakcode/providers/`) built on **litellm**. Default dev model is a local Ollama model;
  OpenAI is the first cloud target. Any litellm provider works via config.
- **Consequences:** Switching providers is config-only. We must handle provider feature
  gaps (e.g. local models lacking native tool-calling) in the provider layer.

## ADR-0005 — Three-layer architecture (core engine / API server / clients)

- **Status:** Accepted (2026-05-30)
- **Context:** Owner wants an API-based core (Claude Code SDK shape) so the CLI is one of
  several possible interfaces (web app, other apps).
- **Decision:** **(1)** `zakcode` core engine as an importable library; **(2)**
  `zakcode-server` (FastAPI, SSE/WebSocket) exposing it over HTTP; **(3)** thin clients,
  CLI first. Clients call the core in-process or the server over HTTP.
- **Consequences:** Clean reuse across interfaces; a small amount of indirection. Detailed
  in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## ADR-0006 — Build via multi-agent workflow orchestration

- **Status:** Accepted (2026-05-30)
- **Context:** A large, multi-day, high-token initiative. Owner asked to "manage a team"
  and keep documentation under central control.
- **Decision:** Build through orchestrated **workflows** (fan-out research, per-subsystem
  implementation pipelines, adversarial verification), with the orchestrator owning the
  docs. Process is defined in [`WORKFLOW.md`](WORKFLOW.md).
- **Consequences:** Parallelism and rigor at scale; requires disciplined scoping and
  verification so parallel work stays coherent.
